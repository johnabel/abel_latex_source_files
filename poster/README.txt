Notes on how to use this:
- in beamerthemeMGH.sty, change the email address abelj@mit.edu to your email address
- place all figures in the "figures" directory
- a logo saved as logo.png or logo.pdf etc. will be placed in the upper right corner. maybe we should standardize this? maybe we should make a neurostatlab logo file with MIT/MGH/NSRL?

- the command \fullpagegraphic{filename} will make a figure that spans a full column
- the command \begin{examplebox}{Title} \end{examplebox} will make a green box highlighting whatever is contained within it


If you want help using this or want to suggest changes to be incorporated permanently, let me know.
